# DevSecOps Framework

## Overview

This DevSecOps framework provides a comprehensive security-first approach to software development and deployment, built on zero trust principles, role-based access controls, and advanced orchestration capabilities. The framework integrates security at every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) while maintaining development velocity and operational efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Azure DevOps organization or GitHub repository
- Azure subscription (for cloud deployments)

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the framework repository**
2. **Configure your orchestration platform** (Azure DevOps/Jenkins/GitHub)
3. **Set up security scanning tools** (GHAS, SonarQube, OWASP ZAP)
4. **Configure branch protection policies** using provided templates
5. **Deploy pipeline templates** to your environment

### Pipeline Configuration

The framework provides ready-to-use pipeline templates:

## Zero Trust Principles

Our DevSecOps framework is built on the foundational principle of "never trust, always verify." This approach ensures that security is embedded at every layer of the development and deployment process.

### Key Zero Trust Implementation:

1. **Continuous Verification**: Every code change, deployment, and access request is continuously validated
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Users and systems are granted only the minimum permissions necessary
3. **Assume Breach**: Security controls are designed assuming that breaches will occur
4. **Explicit Security Validation**: All security checks are explicit and cannot be bypassed

### Security Scanning Integration

![GitHub Advanced Security Issues](../References/Images/ghas_issues.png)

The framework implements comprehensive security scanning including:
- **GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)** for code vulnerability detection
- **CodeQL** analysis for semantic code security scanning
- **Dependency scanning** for open source vulnerabilities
- **Secret scanning** to prevent credential exposure

![SQL Injection Detection](../References/Images/ghas_sc032025_sql_injection.png)

Advanced security scanning capabilities detect critical vulnerabilities like SQL injection attacks, ensuring code quality and security compliance before deployment.

---

## Role-Based Access Controls

The framework implements granular role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that users, systems, and applications have appropriate permissions based on their roles and responsibilities.

### Environment Access Controls

![Production Environment Approvals](../References/Images/prod_env_approval.png)

Production environments are protected with multi-layered approval processes:
- **Required approvals** before production deployments
- **Environment-specific permissions** for different stages
- **Audit trails** for all access and deployment activities

![Production Pipeline Access](../References/Images/prod_env_pipeline_access.png)

Pipeline access to production environments is strictly controlled with:
- Role-based pipeline permissions
- Environment gates and approvals
- Service connection security

### Repository Security Controls

![Repository Branch Policies](../References/Images/repo_branch_policies_1.png)

Branch protection policies enforce:
- **Pull request requirements** with code review mandates
- **Status checks** that must pass before merging
- **Restrictions** on who can push to protected branches

![Branch Policy Requirements](../References/Images/repo_branch_policies_2.png)

Additional branch policies include:
- **Build validation** requirements
- **Required reviewers** for sensitive changes
- **Linear history** enforcement

## Orchestration with Tools

The framework provides seamless orchestration across multiple platforms and tools, enabling teams to work with their preferred technologies while maintaining security and compliance standards.

### Multi-Platform Pipeline Support

![Pipeline Template](../References/Images/pipeline_template.png)

The framework supports multiple orchestration platforms:
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines** for Microsoft-centric environments
- **Jenkins** for on-premises and hybrid deployments
- **GitHub Actions** for GitHub-native workflows

### Template-Based Governance

![Pipeline Template Governance](../References/Images/pipeline_template_governance.png)

Pipeline templates ensure:
- **Consistent security controls** across all pipelines
- **Standardized compliance checks** automatically injected
- **Centralized policy management** for security requirements

![Extending Application Pipeline](../References/Images/extending_app_pipeline.png)

Application teams can extend base templates while maintaining security compliance:
- **Inheritance model** for security controls
- **Customizable stages** for application-specific needs
- **Automatic compliance injection** at build time

### Security Integration Points

![Pull Request Build Validations](../References/Images/pr_build_validations.png)

Every pull request triggers comprehensive validation:
- **Automated security scanning** before code review
- **Build validation** to ensure code compiles
- **Test execution** with coverage requirements

![CodeQL Issues in PR](../References/Images/pr_codeql_issue.png)

Security issues are surfaced directly in pull requests:
- **Inline security feedback** during code review
- **Actionable remediation guidance** for developers
- **Integration with IDE** for real-time security insights
